Let's say you have a photo album, privacy set so only you can see it. Now, you go into said album.. find an awesome picture with your awesome friend in it.. and tag her/his presence in your image.

Instead of that awesome friend only having access to the photo in which s/he was tagged, s/he now has access to **every photo** in what was a previously private album.

Some might not think this is a big deal, but I do. I'd like to be able to tag people in photos without giving them access to the entire album... sometimes I like to tag people in photos just so **I** can remember who was there.. not necessarily to give them access to all of my pictures.

2493,"&gt; When in doubt, DON'T. Women aren't wired that way.

Yes they are? Women are sexual. They like men. They like their bodies. They like seeing them. Not saying you should send them unsolicited. But for the record, the guys doing this are often just fishing and sending those pics to any girl they can as a low effort way to potentially find interest. So it isn't like they ALL think that women totally want random dick pics. 


=

&gt;Absolutely, totally, irrefutably, irrevocably have never had a positive reaction to a dick pic.

I definitely have. I have even had girls ask for one, and initiate the dirty pictures first. Women can be sexual too. This idea that they are ""totally wired differently"" is nonsense. I am not saying they are exactly the same as men either, but they definitely have interest in the bodies of men that they find attractive. 


=

&gt;They may pretend to like your dick pic in order to please your need for affirmation, but deep down the ladies are all like ... eeewwww.

When you speak in absolutes, you are almost always going to end up being wrong. This is one of those times.

3745,"&gt; Id bet you were encouraging these situations at least a little

See, that's the problem I think. What are those guys doing? Hitting on random girls just because they like the form of their boobs? Of course I was encouraging these situations, of course we talked and we both sent subtle signal that we were interested, *that's how it should work*. 

And I'm sure I've missed a lot of opportunities too, specially in the last year since I decided to stay single. But I feel they accumulate and open doors to *better* opportunities. I have a majority of girl friends that I could hit on, but I don't. And I think this kinda leave a scent, you know? That other girls pick up. Anyway, it's known that ignoring girls gets them interested, so there's that and being mysterious and everything. I don't know, you pick up a hobby or two, focus on that, and tada. 

I started a class in CAD (drafting) this winter and I was the only guy who didn't hit on the three girls in the class (eastern European architects, that took a bit of effort I admit). Well what do you know, now they stick with me (and a couple of others) between classes because I'm not trying to fuck them, which is a real fucking miracle of a breather for a girl. So I guess really that's the trick. ",funny

3805,"I've thought about that a lot the past year. People telling you that usually haven't had to worry about living paycheck to paycheck.

Im a young college graduate and throughout college I worked full time and had to pay the bills off a a barely liveable wage but made it work with food stamps /budgeting /never spending and the past year my quality of life has exponentially increased, no *leapt* because I've gotten a couple dollar raise, and then even more than that, in the union job I work.

 I never have to think about living paycheck to paycheck anymore, I have savings, I can go to the dentist and doctor whenever I want, buy food not on sale (though I still tend to), and make random purchases whenever I want. The past couple months after I graduated I've been delving into my hobbies and am just excited about life in general like never before, because I have so much time to think about what I want and CAN do. This is from a lot of things but the root of it is having a wage where I don't have to constantly plan my life around living paycheck to paycheck. 

It's really astounding and it's not like I'm rich or anything by any means. But the quality of my life and who I feel like as a person is completely different because I don't have that constant stress fog hanging around me of ""can I afford this?"", ""will this leave enough for next week?"" etc etc. And also having the safety of mind knowing I have savings for emergencies and also having the ability to help my friends and family out when they need it.

This change has really opened my eyes since I thought I had experienced what my financial life would entail as an adult for my future from the past 4 years: Constant stress, sacrificing opportunities or quality products due to price, and overall just worrying and constantly planning. It makes me frustrated at the way our system is made because I feel extremely lucky to be in my position (although I have worked my ass off every minute to get here) where I can make an affordable wage and there are so many people out there that deserve the same, and more, and have been met with road blocks by our system. 

Anyway, this topic is really close to heart for me as I watched my parents work their ass off my whole life and barely get anywhere and being here now is really important to me, and graduating too since no one has done that in my family. I just hate our system. It's fucked. We all deserve a livable wage, whatever that is I don't know. I have just been obsessed with thinking what kind of people we'd all be when we can actively pursue our interests and hobbies, buy that new TV or kayak we want, and plan for emergencies and afford gifts for our families without constantly stressing about it. We'd all be a lot more whole.

The average person doesn't need much protein. There's a lot of misinformation and bad science out there about incomplete protein and such, but you don't need to combine anything. For people who DO need more protein (for example lifters) it gets more tricky because you don't have stuff like grilled chicken. My go-tos were TVP, tofu, beans, and seitan. Protein shakes made up the difference, but I didn't find I needed to supplement when bulking. Cutting was rough though, without protein powder it would be rough.  ",funny

Firstly, that's exactly what the first comment in this thread argued. The argument was that they're ""paid below minimum wage"" and that's not the case.

There's nothing I've been wrong on here. You've failed at pedantry, you've failed at semantics, you've failed at every approach you've tried. Minimum wage does not leave tipped workers behind, they are still paid above and at the very worst equal to minimum wage.

1. OSX IS based on BSD, but BSD has distinct differences from Linux, including the base licensing differences between GPL and BSD licenses, i.e. Linux you MUST publish source code, BSD allows binary only distribution. That is likely the reason why OSX is BSD based and not Linux based, but you loose the 'guarantee' that the source will be available to tweak/modify as you wish, which is one of the advantages Linux has over both Windows and OSX. Obviously this only extends to the OS, as you can use other-licensed tools on each OS.

2. Its UNIX compatible, which means nothing in relation to Linux (which is Unix based, but not ported or restricted) or windows (which has nothing to do with Unix). Its really only saying ""this is a port of a server based system thats known for stability and security.

3. Both Windows and Linux are flexible in terms of hardware. BSD is somewhat flexible but less so, and OSX is even less flexible than BSD.

There are things you can do on a Windows and Linux machine that just aren't that easy on a Mac machine, and vice versa. At the end of the day, OSX is an OS meant for simplicity, and thus abstracts a lot of things away by deciding how they will be done. This is actually a good thing, as typically the decision of how something is going to be done is made properly, and the OS is easier and better for it. Those that are more specific in how they are using their system, or who do things outside the 95% typical use patters will have more trouble with Macs than they will with Windows, and more trouble with macs and windows then they will with Linux. 

SO yeah, Macs are more or less as flexible as pc's, with the exception of hardware support which is by design. This doesn't mean that flexibility is as easily achieved with a mac, or that the ease of use of a mac will be found on a windows or linux machine (far from it actually)",funny

Here's the thing. His GENDER is what is PERCEIVED by SOCIETY. How often do you see strangers' hanging dicks in a day? If a man in a dress looks and sounds and behaves like a woman because they identify as a woman, then as far as you are concerned their gender is a woman. Until you are in the most intimate of situations, you would not know their sex. Hell, if a woman is unfortunate enough to be born with severely masculine features but still identifies as a woman, is it our right to question whether or not she's secretly a man in a dress? It doesn't MATTER to you what they have, because it doesn't AFFECT you unless you're fucking them.

I'll side step your denial of God  since there can be no productive (in as much as any discussion is productive) fruit from that line of discussion. The thrust of that passage was to point out that humans have evolved to eat and the eating of meat critical (based on studies done by anthropologist) to our success as a species and the development of cognizance. 

Every dietary association agrees that a 'well managed and informed' vegetarian diet can be healthy at all stages of life. Unfortunately those qualifiers (used explicitly and specifically in scientific papers) disqualify the vast majority of the population from ever falling under the umbrella of those studies (aka those studies are not credible evidence that there is not necessarity to kill animals in order to eat them) . The average  omnivorous human does not have a 'well managed and informed' diet, so the studies done about the '1%' of vegans are not scientifically viable to he used to generalize for the general population. A basic understanding of statistics would show that studies that target specific, self-selecting populations are not useful science for generalizing the behaviors of a larger population. 

So even in spite of my (relative) ignorance on this specific field, I can look at the population sizes of the studies done (one study had ~140 people across the entirety of Ireland) and see they are bad science. 

Any good scientist should be skeptical of any result, especially in today's academic atmosphere of 'publish or perish' and significantly misrepresented statistics. 

In short, there is still a necessity for killing animals, and that is to eat them. Killing animals in order to eat them is not immoral (as opposed to killing them for sport  or for trophies). 


The presence of a brain and a central nervous system are not required for sentience. If you're using some specific, exhaustive definition you need to share it so we can use like terms (and to keep you from moving the goal post) . I already define sentience as 'the ability to feel or perceive things' and then provided the evidence that organic plant matter possesses these capabilities. 

I have no idea what a Chalmers is (Google says he is a philosopher?). I'm not sure what point you're trying to reach here. 

You realize that plants also react to their environment and nutritional needs? Is it because you lack the ability to perceive their responses that you think they don't have one? I assure you if a plant is lacking in water or nutrients you can visually identify that through changes in the plants structure/appearance. 

If neither law nor religion is a framework through which to discuss morals, then how can any moral decision have any foundation? To be more specific, how do you decide that an action is moral or immoral (excluding any religious or law based factors)? Are you arguing for the *innate morality * of an act? I have already demonstrated that absolute morality is fallacious. 

I mean literally by definition, when slavery was legal it was acceptable. In fact, there are moral systems (not yours obviously but other such systems exist) that still allow slavery. While most of these systems have disappeared (and those that do have never allowed colonial style slavery in the first place) some still exist and are wildly popular. I assume by 'acceptable' you meant morally acceptable, in which case yes there is morally acceptable slavery (for me personally). Since your moral system has no foundation (except your personal fiat) I laugh in the face of your judgement. 

Colonial style slavery is morally unacceptable, but that is because of the way that the slaves were treated, not because of any innately immorality of a slave system. The foundation of my moral system is God, and he allows it. The foundation of your moral system (such as it is) appears to be you, and you don't allow it. I know who I will listen to. ",funny

8854,"There was a guy who studied baboons who noticed the same behavior in them. The dominant ones would pick on everyone and everyone would take out their aggression on the baboons lower down the pecking order than themselves. If you were at the bottom you had it the worst. The bottom-level baboons had all kinds of stress-induced illnesses that a lot of humans have too. 

Fun story: A restaurant near the baboon preserve had a dump out back and the baboons would forage around it for scraps. The dominant males took all the meat for themselves, of course, and left nothing for anyone else. Then they started dropping dead. _All_ the dominant males dropped dead. It turns out the meat was tainted with hepatitis. By being greedy fucks who cared nothing for anyone else they rather ironically saved the entire group from extinction.

What was amazing was the way the culture of the group changed after all the douche bags dropped dead. There were far fewer fights, less stress, more grooming behaviors. Everyone was a lot happier and a lot better off.

SPOILERS if you haven't read/seen Inferno.

The characters spend the story tracking down this contagion that a mad scientist is trying to unleash on the world as a population control measure.  Mystery ensues, blah blah blah, we get to the end; they figure the location where the bad guy is releasing this contagion and make their way there.  The dude put a gallon of this virus/bacteria/whatever into a dissolving plastic bag in an underground cistern.  He videotapes this bag that is set to dissolve and release the toxin in a week (or whatever), infecting humanity, etc etc.  

In the book, they find the location supposedly just in time to prevent the bag bursting.  Tension builds as they look for it, and finally they do. The twist is that they found just an empty bag; the contagion had already been released and infecting people (unknown to anyone) for days. The end result is that the infection spreads around the world, and makes 1/3 of humans infertile (rather than outright killing people); thus accomplishing the scientist's goal of reducing the population.  It was a great if somewhat dark ending to the book.

In the movie however, they Hollywood-ize it to where it doesn't even make the same point (that overpopulation is actually a bad thing, the 'mad' scientist guy was right).  They arrive to find the bag still intact (of course), and contain it (of course), thus saving humanity (of course) from just another insane mass murderer.  Completely missing the point.

If you ever saw 'I am Legend' (Will Smith with dog and zombies, 2007-ish), it had a similar so-called ""controversial"" alternate ending to the movie that humanized the zombies and made an interesting ending.  This was removed from the final version (of course), instead showing the zombies as vile evil monsters (of course), and the survivors escaping and saving humanity (of course).

&gt;Matthew 5:17-20King James Version (KJV)

&gt;17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

&gt;18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.

&gt;19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.


Last I checked, heaven and earth are still here. Consider carefully His admonishment against teaching others to ignore the Law or parts of it (not the rulings of the Pharisees, but the Law of God given to Moses which Christ lived and taught in full).


&gt;John 15:10King James Version (KJV)

&gt;10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.


While Christ says the essence of the Law (or the ""point of it/ summation of it"" if you will) is to ""love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind, and your neighbor as yourself"", He does not diminish or take away from what God has given. 

Modern Christianity is only loosely based on Christ's actual teachings and only vaguely centered around following Him. For further information on this distortion one need only read the Gospels then read Paul's writings (spoiler: Paul does not teach the same thing Christ did, and actually contradicts Him while claiming to serve Him). Also, the very opening of Revelation has Christ give praise to the church in Ephesus (a church Paul spent much time with) for recognizing ""one who claims to be an apostle and is not"". Guess who called himself the ""greatest apostle""? Paul. On this distinction I would GREATLY encourage even just an afternoon's worth of research.

Anyway, back to the point/reply, there is no separate covenant or doing away with the Old Testament. That does not mean that Christians are to be dicks. We are commanded to love with the same mercy and care that He showed to others. He is the example, and for those that would judge He gave a telling quote:


&gt;Matthew 7King James Version (KJV)

&gt;1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

&gt;2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

&gt;3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

&gt;4 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

&gt;5 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.


Mankind is unfit to judge one another as no individual on earth is a perfect and flawless being. Thus, we are to leave that to God and His Christ, who are. 

This does NOT mean that one is relegated to passively accepting evil or not encouraging others along a more righteous path; one need only look at Christ's actions in life to confirm this (""you are forgiven, go now and *sin no more*"", emphasis mine, as well as chasing the money changers and His various other admonishments of willful deceivers such as the Pharisees, defilers such as money changers abusing the house of God, etc)

**TL;DR** Teaching that the Law has changed or been done away with directly goes against the teachings of Christ Himself (who is the highest authority in this matter), but this does not mean that we humans are fit to be arbiters of the Law and the Commandments. We are to show mercy and love to one another, to guide by the light of a life lived by Christ's example and in proper communion with God, because we all fall short in one way or another.",funny

17511,"Yes, my translation reads ""men who submit to homosexual acts, men who practice homosexuality."" not just ""homosexuals""... also Romans 1:26,27 mentions women as well.  The direction is clear to both sexes, really.

Regarding your thoughts on people putting too much worth in it, i disagree.  But if you'll notice in 1 Corinthians 6:9, it puts those men who practice homosexual acts in the same boat as those who are ""sexually immoral"" or ""adulterers"", so sexual acts between unmarried heteros is at the same level.

Re: two men kissing, i suppose you're right.  But regarding two lesbians touching each other intimately, i disagree.  If you were to research more into the greek words there referring to that sexual immorality, it's ""porneia"" which may have a familiar root word.  This really covers anything that constitutes sexual contact between unmarried people.  Two people kissing each other on the mouth isn't sexual contact.

17543,"Alright, first off we don't even know this guy is charging a cell phone, all we see is a wire. It could be a flashlight for all we know. And a cell phone is not a luxury item nowadays, whether it's an iPhone or not. 

When I was homeless I was given an old second gen iPhone as a donation. I didnt pay a monthly plan, I just used wifi so I didnt pay anything, so no my donations weren't going towards phone upkeep. But a phone is completely necessary and not a luxury because pay phones don't exist anymore in most cities--how does a homeless person contact the police if they are faced with trouble?

And for the record, you may be right that certain business owners not want in you to charge your phone outside, but those business owners very likely wouldn't allow a homeless person to be panhandling outside in the first place. 

In my experience business owners who don't mind you hanging around also don't at all mind you using their outlet a few hours a day. Besides, over the course of a year it costs about 25 cents total to charge a phone. What a burden on the business. Not like a business owner who is sympathetic to the homeless would ever throw 25 cents to a homeless person. 

I'm not saying that when I was homeless I didn't care, but that you know what places are feasible places to panhandle and which ones aren't. If a business owner had ever asked me to leave or unplug, I would, that's no question. ",funny

**What is the fourth of July?**

Celebration of independence of the States from Britain. I think the date was used because two presidents shared a birthday? Thinking Lincoln and another?

**Who is Abraham Lincoln?**

Fourth(?) American president, president during the Civil War. Wrote and delivered the speech on the Lincoln memorial (was there in June) whose start I know but is currently escaping me.

**Something significantly different?**

Dunno what's being got at here; there's a huge amount of difference. The most obvious difference is the number of states that made it up.

**Supreme court ruling?**

No idea.

**Better president**

Franklin was never president.

**Denominations of American currency**

Coins - Cents, 5¢ and quarters (25¢). Also dollar coins do exist but are unpopular.

Notes - $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100

**Prohibition**

Period of time in the 1920/30s (?) where alcohol was illegal. This was when cocktails were invented to mask the godawful taste of the homemade spirits that people drank. I don't know why it ended (unenforceable?) but I guess it was a change in government.

**What is Vietnam?**

Country in South East Asia, Eastern most country of the peninsula which it shares with Thailand, Cambodia and Laos.

**Direction of the U.K. from America**

East-North-East.

**World War II**

The Hitler one, 1939 to 1945. The bombing of Pearl Habor by the Japanese in August? 1942 drew the U.S. into the war.

**Other Wars**

World War I, Vietnam War, First and Second Gulf Wars, Afghanistan (x2).

**Original colonies**

No idea. The founding fathers famously set off from Portsmouth and landed in Portsmouth.

**First President**

George Washington, there were presidents before him due some technicality that I can't remember.

**Watergate**

Hotel in Washington, D.C. where Nixon's aide was caught by the Washington Post(?) in some nefarious business of one kind or another. The whistle-blower was known as Deep Throat.

**Clinton's V.P.**

20080,"&gt;The word autumn comes from the ancient Etruscan root autu- and has within it connotations of the passing of the year.[11] It was borrowed by the neighbouring Romans, and became the Latin word autumnus.[12] After the Roman era, the word continued to be used as the Old French word autompne (automne in modern French) or autumpne in Middle English,[13] and was later normalised to the original Latin. In the Medieval period, there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th century, it was in common use.

...

&gt;The alternative word fall for the season traces its origins to old Germanic languages. The exact derivation is unclear, with the Old English fiæll or feallan and the Old Norse fall all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning ""to fall from a height"" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like ""fall of the leaf"" and ""fall of the year"".[16]

23534,"Funny that you're belaboring this point so much and claiming that you're *not* a pedant.  Here's another way to look at it so maybe you'll understand why you're not making sense:

No death is ""certain"" until it happens.  Logically, any situation where you are not yet dead could resolve itself such that you remain alive, since anything is possible.  If your parachute doesn't open, it could turn out that somebody piled up a bunch of mattresses underneath you, or a tornado could sweep through and pull you out of the air and drop you in a lake.  

So when you say ""you're still wrong, you can risk death without it being certain"" you are absolutely correct.  What you're missing is that you **can't** risk death **with** certainty.  There is never certainty until it happens.  You know the line in Anchorman, ""sixty percent of the time, it works every time?""  The reason that is a *joke* is that he is applying certainty to a situation while admitting that the outcome is not at all certain. 

""Risking certain death"" is never correct.",funny

If people want gender identity to be a thing, it needs its own original word. You can't try to change ""gender"" into a new word. It's always been the g-rated version of ""sex"".

My personal feelings are that the concept is misguided. Humans like putting things into categories. Gender identity is just... more categorizing.

Same goes for food service. I don't have a complicated order but if you ask for how I want my burger/meat and I say medium then I'd like it medium. Don't come back with a well cooked piece of meat.

But if you just take an order and then someone  else brings the food and I don't see you again till I get a bill...tell me what exactly was done to earn extra $$$? I'm paying for the food, and I'll even tip 10-12% but I won't toss down 20%

When you drop one cup into another, you have to displace the air inside the receiving cup.  As the dropping cup enters into the receiving cup, the amount of space becomes less than the air can efficiently escape, thereby causing compressed air (which is an area of high pressure).

By spinning the cup, you cause the air to also spin within the high pressure area, But are also pulling in air, due to the shape of the cups, allowing the pressure differential to last longer than if there were no spin.

Then he blows into the area where the air is escaping (along a tangent that's prograde to the spin).  This adds more air volume into the compressed air, eventually creating enough pressure differential to lift the cup, which moves away from where he was blowing at.",funny

32527,"tradition which itself is inconveniencing. If you categorize religion or the delusions as an inconvenience, I highly suggest that you re-evaluate the damages, setbacks and wars that these things cause. I don't point out Christianity in general. All religions are a problem and prevent us from moving on. While we do see Unitarian Universalism and ""humanist"" religions manage to become solid organizations from time to time, that's more tolerance than anything. Like I said, you can't argue someone's religious beliefs. To be more clear, you can't counter everything that someone identifies with, at least not at once.

As for the ""a group of volunteer US federal employees"" you mentioned, I don't discriminate career or occupation when in my definition of ""hippy"". I guess it would've been better served with something more concretely demeaning? Pseudo-intellectual hipsters following the Voices in popular culture? That sounds better at least and it less metaphoric anyway. 

My point on money and effort is highlighted by the fact that the movement you mention is volunteer-based. As a collective (hive), the United States really does stand indivisible. Exceptions aren't made, large sweeping changes aren't adopted. The maxim ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it"" sums up the philosophy adopted by many. In other words, if it works, even half-ass ""and we can't afford to change it now"" we're not overhauling it.

The context in which I mentioned tradition. Have you given much thought to the dynasties of thought or mindset that get passed down to people? Thought constructs, ideas, code (written or unwritten), meme system; whichever word you identify with more. They're passed down through the generations. Approximately 10 generations ago (and in some cases less) we were living with British folk on our continent, a part of Britain (don't correct me if I'm wrong), wearing white wigs and then soon after our legal and political systems started to be created. Over the years, these things have been re-adopted and unchanged. Your use of PLAIN to illustrate that real, educated people want change is fine. I agree. The same can be said of MENSA, though there's some debate over the hard facts of what the founders had in mind. This search: http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=mensa+advise+government gives a good idea of a resource, like PLAIN that is going to waste because of tradition and the idea/meme that the US as a whole has a destiny, which in some way is linked to the divine and it's as it should be. One of the hardest things for me to come to grips with is the stoic, focused manner in which our elected officials that are not in touch with the level of information today and the  amount of information which has been proven false or newly found. Part of this comes from having little interest or being unable to use computers. The attitudes that go along with being old, out of date, Christian (and in many cases believing that God put you where you are, take Rick Perry, doing his religious service as a Governor here in Texas where I live, he's just vocal about it, many other elected officials have been quoted saying similar things). 

Religious folks or not, especially those in generations prior to those born in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and 00s - tend to avoid the details and facts when it comes to what they use in the world. I'm sorry, it's not just the fundamentalists who take the bible seriously or don't care anymore, that's an argument made by many. It's a sign of the times when people associate themselves with a church or ministry that's doing good to be part of doing good, yet lack the most basic education about God. It's not a failure in teaching or a failure in learning. Most of the people born sub-1950 had shitty educations. We still even now have shitty educations, much less the theological teachings that are pro-Christian being taught in church / bible school to kids and adults.

The fact is that our nation consists of a majority population that couldn't give a damn about what's right, what needs to be fixed, what's accurate, what's fair and what needs to be done. Need implies now. Some of these old farts are catching on and it's quite obvious that they're moving with the will of the people and the world as it is now that they can see and acknowledge. But that doesn't negate that we have 50 to 70 year olds in positions of power that were created along with our ""dynasties of thought and process"" when the population was much smaller, much less was known about the world in general and even more so on a personal level. The only time we'll see change is when someone who is brilliant and 30 now is elected to the office of President of the US or the leader of other nations. I doubt we'll see even a drop in age limit, because of course you have to be old to be wise and competent in those eyes. What's more is that by the time those my age now are elected to office, no doubt many will be bitter or have fallen in line with the traditions as they exist now. What disturbs me the most is that if you're not associated with a religious group and claim to be Christian I'd be willing to bet that (in the US and in some cases other countries) you're not going to get elected to office in any capacity governing a large population. I'd be willing to bet that the average age of PLAIN is 30-50. Because those are the people who have been most exposed to what a problem these systems are. I'd also venture a guess that they haven't had much of an impact. These people, these guys and gals who get elected into office believe that because they're in office, they make the decisions that affect us all and just because you know better and can prove it doesn't give you the right to override their authority. It's sad and sick. I'm not equating that with Divine Right, but you do the math and once you check the work tell me if I'm wrong or right. I know I'm right. Even more so what's fucked up about it is, that those who control those positions or are in them believe firmly that they don't have to listen to the people, especially those that count most - our most brilliant, educated and intelligent. Sure, they seek their counsel at times but that's not allowing them to advise and check you. If our nation is doomed to failure or ""destined"" to keep slowing itself down and hurting our own people, that's the reason. 

I mean, take the presidential election. We don't vote on a president. We vote on electors and those in areas where they can get to vote or have the means and ability to vote elect the electors. Going a bit further into that, the electors can address half of he population of an area in most cases by addressing Churches and having Churches support them. The same goes for all electoral processes. But really, we don't vote on the president. There's room in there for people to not get a chance on it. There's movements fighting to get the vote back to the people, too, because this would make a change that fits in with our liberties and rights. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)",funny

&gt; By a man wearing a dress, he does not change the fact he has a dick between his legs.

Here's the thing. His GENDER is what is PERCEIVED by SOCIETY. How often do you see strangers' hanging dicks in a day? If a man in a dress looks and sounds and behaves like a woman because they identify as a woman, then as far as you are concerned their gender is a woman. Until you are in the most intimate of situations, you would not know their sex. Hell, if a woman is unfortunate enough to be born with severely masculine features but still identifies as a woman, is it our right to question whether or not she's secretly a man in a dress? It doesn't MATTER to you what they have, because it doesn't AFFECT you unless you're fucking them.

Let's break the planet into particles (Science is dangerous), and remove particles that cancel one another out. Starting with your left hand, there will be no particles matching those closest to you; along the left wall. Particles on the right wall will correspond to particles past the left wall, the same distance apart. By the time you've accounted for the entire planet, there will be two groups that do not have a match: a cluster to your left (The same size and shape as the cavity you occupy), and a half-circle shell comprising the right-most particles of the planet, with thickness the same as the cavity. Comparing these two groups; first of all, there is an absurd difference in proximity. Secondly, the nearby group will have dramatically more density, as it occupies the center of the Earth. So, while the half-shell group has more volume, it may not have more mass. The left arm will be pulled towards the nearby cluster at forces than render the half-shell group negligible, but it remains to be calculated how strong this force is in the first place.

Assuming you are in a 3m diameter cavity, and assuming wikipedia's estimates of the core density of the Earth are accurate, the mass to the left will be a bit under 100 metric tonnes. At a distance of 1.5m to the center of its mass, the left arm will experience a gravitational pull of... Negligibly small amount. I concede to your conclusion",funny

So, I start beating about his face and the bastard is still hanging on. I grab a nearby hammer and start smashing his fingers, and he finally lets go and falls. That asshole hit the ground from six stories up, and some how he is still alive, trying to crawl away. Caught up in my rage I run to the kitchen, grab the fridge and throw it down on him. As the fridge left my hands, the stress caught up with me, and I had a heart attack.""

St. Peter looks at the man in horror ""Unfortunate, certainly, but deserved! To hell with you!"" and the man vanishes in a flash of fire and brimstone.

A second man walks up ""St. Peter, I died horribly. I am a pretty athletic guy, so today after work when I had a few minutes to do some exercise, it was nice outside and I decided to do it out on my balcony. There I was, doing jumping jacks, when I slipped and fell over the railing. I guess god was watching over me as by some miracle I managed to grab on to the railing of the balcony below me. As I was trying to pull myself up, this guy came out to have a smoke. I made to ask for help, but instead he started punching me in the face! Just when I thought I endured the torture and started to pull myself up again, the guy returns with a hammer and starts hammering away at my fingers! There was too much pain to hold on, and I fell. I hit the ground, thanking god for his mercy, only to find I cannot move my legs. So I tried crawling towards the street to get help, but the last thing I remember is looking up at a fridge flying towards me!""

St. Peter looks at the poor man, feeling great pity for him, and says ""That is indeed unfortunate! Heaven awaits your tortured soul.""

A third man walks up. ""St. Peter, I too died horribly..""

St. Peter looks over the broken man ""Tell me, my son, for heaven awaits.""

We have many people who come in and may only have $15 of food but $50 of alcohol, so a $3 tip would show me you didn't like my service (even at 33% of food) $10 tip would show me I did just fine (around 15% of $65 total).

And before you go ahead and say ""well, don't those costs get passed on to the consumer?"" No, they don't.  Firstly, pharmaceutical costs are among the lesser costs in American health care spending. Why? Drugs are modular and can have economics similar to software. Doctors actually account for most of the cost yet people are reluctant to talk about that and doctors are extremely reluctant to take pay cuts. Secondly, think for just a moment about how insignificant the costs for a drug that serves 500 people are. Estimates pegged it at less than $100 million.

Of course maybe this was not something he knew until recently at which point he was planning on revealing that information to her in the form of this game? Not likely a husband is going to let that secret out in such a ridiculous way such as this. I mean look at his face; he's smiling like an idiot (if infertility were the context). Infertility can be a very dark and depressing issue to face, and I'm sure that's going to be a long, tear-filled conversation between the two of them. No chalk boards and certainly no cameras capturing their reaction.

I'm sorry, but even if you can suspend reality enough to believe that this cold-hearted doofus would write on a chalkboard, in front of a camera, the news that he was infertile to surprise his wife, there is no way it could time perfectly with his wife finding out she's pregnant.

So now you'll see all these people saying ""selling wolf tickets"", or ""wolf tickets"", or apparently now just shortened to ""selling tickets"" - none of whom knew this term or used it just a year ago. 

You'll know because no one who uses it can explain the 'wolf' part, because it was already an obscure reference in the little-known song.

Even then, that's only a lifeskill situation. Beyond that, the army is not a safe place for women. Again, in Canada, military rape goes largely unreported. That's fucked.

64172,"First off, we were talking about insects, not snakes or cuddlefish (which are quit intelligent). You would be right to say it's wrong for people to see them without sympathy, but the majority of people would definitely sympathize with a fish. There was a post of a fish being fried alive by a sushi chef not that long ago. There was a lot of outrage in the comments sections and I didn't see any jokes. 

And insects being merciless and cold is because they don't have a conscience and don't think twice about any and all actions. Being merciless, cold, cruel, and calculative is not synonymous with having a personality. Plus, I never said insects don't have personalities. They do, but this personality pretty much manifests itself in varying behavior (e.g. one bug might crawl one direction while another might crawl a different direction).

&gt;Who the hell are you to call them ""expendable""?

Don't try to make me look like a bad person. They have *evolved* to be expendable. Meaning that they have evolved to reproduce quickly, grow quickly, and die quickly. The individual is less important to the species as a whole. In the insects world, life is cheap and if a hundred thousand of a species die, it would barely make a dent in the total population. I don't consider them expendable, they are expendable. 

&gt;Also you provided NO citing for your assertions. In fact, most of them are just opinions.

It's funny how people will only demand citation when they disagree with something. My assertions are common knowledge. Insects are barely conscience. Their brain is simply a small bundle of nerves. They lack the biological structures that are necessary for higher brain function and thought. Yes, they are alive and do possess some sort of primitive consciousness, but it's barely there.

Thank you for contacting General Mills about Chex snack mix. We are pleased to learn of your interest. 



 

Unfortunately, we are unable to market separate particulates or components of this product. Our products are packaged and sold only as complete units.    **(I asked them if they would, could, or ever will sell JUST the chex part with the traditional seasonings on them)**




In 2009, changes were made to all of our Chex Mix products. One of the changes made to the Traditional Chex Mix was that the bagel chips were removed from the product. These changes were due to marketing decisions made concerning these products.    **(I asked what happened to the bagel chips!!!)**

66925,"The studies that attempt to show that rape is a vastly underreported crime often rely on bullshit, or are very old.  For instance, the [1 in 4 college women are raped guilt trip](http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.html).  *""she doesn't think she was raped, but we say it was rape""* Words mean things.  Rape is unwanted sex through gained through force or serious threats.  Some feminists attempt to define rape as essentially sex which makes a women feel bad.  But that doesn't make it rape.

So, honestly, fuck off with the guilt trip stats stuff.  If you rape someone and hurt them, you'll go to jail.  ""Men"" are not rapists.  Those who choose to rape are rapists, and there are penalties.

As for underreported things, lets talk about prison rape.  I've seen some studies that show that when you account for prison rape, the per capita stats for rape equalize.  It's not just a woman's concern.

Also, fuck off with the *only so recently, women had it soooo bad!*.  So did men -- they died in terrible working conditions, wars, and other crappy situations trying to defend and provide for those women.  Male and female feminists everywhere are fond of holding up the *rich, executive white guy* as somehow being the good comparison to show how bad women had it.  

It's a big social movement focusing on a non-problem, because it's an issue that is *already being dealt with*.

The only reason more people don't say what I'm saying in polite company is because socially (and perhaps instinctually) we see upsetting women as being a bad idea.  That's why society puts up with stupid things like the Slut Walk.  Immature, dumb faux-activism which probably has a lot to do with it being a socially acceptable way for unattractive or sex-nervous women to try and objectify themselves *because objectification is part of sex for everyone!*  Even if you don't want to think of it that way.

And what is it about that type of place that leaves them with such low profit margins?

Why is it then that in other parts of the world, where gas costs more, they are capable of paying their staff properly. Am I missing something here? Do these places just need to hire less terrible managers or what? Does the food cost 3x as much in other countries or is it because of portion size?

69347,"&gt; As I understand it, this happens all the time, in every language.
&gt; 

As far as I'm aware that's true, but many languages also have regulatory bodies called a [language regulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_language_regulators), language authority, or language academy.  Many such authorities release [prescriptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_prescription) dictionaries to set spelling and pronunciation.  The [1996 German reform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_orthography_reform_of_1996) is an example of a language authority dictating how a language is used.  That doesn't man that the language doesn't still a develop through usage, it just means it's not the only way the language develops and there's no way to stop it.  

French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese (multiple exist), Japanese, Russian, Swahili, Hindi, Arabic, etc. all have language authorities.  English is unusual in being a language so widely spoken without any language regulator.

English does have some regulation, but it's indirect.  It has dictionary publishers, and it was those being published that first set English spelling.  That's why when you read English from before the existence of the printing press, the spelling is so different.  That's also why American and British spellings differ: our dictionaries have diverged on spelling because our dictionary publishers were different.  English also has several [controlled versions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_natural_language), too.

Most of it seem to indicate he MIGHT be a real person but as any stories and legends that exaggerate the might of kings and rulers, it could be true that Jesus' story could have been wildly exaggerated. Jesus came from humble backgrounds.

Take note of the book Gilgamesh. The ruler of Uruk and possibly the first great civilization this current era of humanity has seen. The book of Gilgamesh vastly exaggerates Gilgamesh's upbringing by saying he is the son of a goddess and the gods take part in his journey to save Enkidu. While he probably did journey to try to save his friend or lover, stories of Gilgamesh is probably based on a true story that has been wildly exaggerated and romanticized as all literature documenting ""great men"" do.",funny
